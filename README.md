This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons. The script `bug.vbs` contains a function that compares two values. Due to VBScript's type coercion, the comparison might not behave as expected if the inputs are of different types. The solution in `bugSolution.vbs` addresses this by explicitly converting the inputs to the same data type before comparison, ensuring consistent and predictable results.
